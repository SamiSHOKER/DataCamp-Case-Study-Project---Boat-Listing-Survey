# DataCamp-Case-Study-Project---Boat-Listing-Survey

This repository contains all the elements for the case study that I got in order to obtain my Professional Data scientist Certification from DataCamp. 

This case study is about  predicting and analysing boat's views in order to boost traffic on the website by preventing to list boat's that would not have high number on views. On top of that, it was required to assess feature's importance in order to study to possiblilty of trimming the survey in order to increase the number of people who signes up since there were lots on incompleted surveys.

To solve this problem, I started by cleaning the data and then followed that by analysing the relationship between the number of views and each of the other characteristics by choosing the propre method. In the end, I build a machine learning model that was CATBOOST regression and analysed the feature's importance. I chose this model beacause it works really well when having lot's of categorical data in addition to it's good performance.

Main Challenges of this case study :
- Having categorical data with lots of distinct values (more than 2000).
- Feature transformation and feature engineering.
- Choosing a suitable machine learning model that can handle this big number of categorical features.
